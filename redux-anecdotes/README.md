# Redux Anecdotes

This is a Redux-powered version of the Anecdotes voting application. It's built as part of the [Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com) course and gradually evolves through exercises 6.3 to 6.19.

The application allows users to:
- View a list of anecdotes
- Vote for their favorite ones
- Add new anecdotes
- Filter anecdotes by keyword
- Receive notifications on actions
- Sync data with a backend using Redux Thunk

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- React
